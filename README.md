Update your [Simply Plural](https://apparyllis.com/) system fronting status automatically to
* your [VRChat](https://hello.vrchat.com/) status message
* your website as HTML

## SimplyPlural to VRChat Status

When running locally as a VRChat-Updater, it'll check the fronting status
on SimplyPlural periodically and update the VRChat status to reflect the current fronts
e.g. `F: Alice, Bob, Claire`.

For this, simply [download the latest executable](https://github.com/GollyTicker/simply-plural-to-any-updater/releases/latest) and run it locally. It'll create an empty file and ask you to put in your SimplyPlural and VRChat credentials.
These credentials are necessary for it to do it's job. After writing the credentials,
run the executable again. It will first login into VRChat. You may need to provide
a 2FA code, if you hav configured one for your account. Then it'll automatically
update your status in VRChat priodically from SimplyPlural. The login is saved in a cookie,
so you won't need to input your 2FA code that often.

## SimplyPlural to Website

When running as a website (`SERVE_API=true`), it serves an endpoint `/fronting`
and provides a HTML page with the current fronting status (from SimplyPlural)
as a well-rendered UI.

To run the webserver, simply define a `deploy.env` with the relevant variables and run `restart-services.sh`. It uses a docker compose setup. You can stop services via `stop-services.sh`.

## FAQ

**Why is my member name not shown correctly?**

VRChat has limitations on what it allows one to show in the VRChat Status message.
While most european letters and accents are supported, special things such as emojis are not.
Hence this tool removes them before forwarding them to VRChat. If you think something is being removed,
while it's actually possible in the VRChat status, then shortly contact me and let me know (or write an issue).

*NOTE: The following feature doesn't currently work due to limitations on SimplyPlural API*: Furthermore, if a member has a name which cannot be represented at all, e.g. `üíñ‚≠ê`, then you can define a new
custom field in your Simply Plural named `VRChat Status Name` and fill in a VRChat compatible name in that field,
e.g. `Sparkle Star`. This way you can keep on using the proper name in Simply Plural while also having
something readable in VRChat.
